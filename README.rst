scikit-qlearn: Quantum Enhanced Machine Learning
=================================================

This package offers a variety of functions and classes related to quantum computing and quantum enhanced machine learning algorithms.

The package makes use of the open-source `Qiskit SDK <https://qiskit.org/>`_ for the execution of quantum processes.

It was orginally developed as part of my end-of-degree thesis for my Computer Engineering degree at UAM.

Documentation
=============

The documentation is available at `danmohedano.github.io/scikit-qlearn/ <https://danmohedano.github.io/scikit-qlearn/>`_

Installation
=============
Currently, the package is available for Python versions 3.7-3.10, regardless of platform. Stable versions are available for install via `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/scikit-qlearn/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install scikit-qlearn

The latest version can also be manually installed by cloning the main branch of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/danmohedano/scikit-qlearn.git
   pip install ./scikit-qlearn

Requirements
--------------
*scikit-qlearn* depends on the following packages:

* `qiskit <https://github.com/Qiskit>`_ - Open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms.
* `numpy <https://github.com/numpy/numpy>`_ - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
