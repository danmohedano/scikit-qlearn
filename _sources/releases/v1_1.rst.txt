Version 1.1
==============

Changes:

* Included tutorials in the documentation.
* Implementation of degrees in :py:class:`AmplitudeEncoding` and :py:class:`ExpandedAmplitudeEncoding` to define the amount of repetitions of the quantum state. This in turns makes possible the implementation of polynomial kernels.
* Unification of :py:mod:`utils` and :py:mod:`jobhandler` modules to reduce code cluttering and better comprehension of the package structure.
* Minor bugfixes.
