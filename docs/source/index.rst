Welcome to scikit-qlearn's documentation!
=========================================
This package offers a variety of functions and classes related to quantum computing and quantum enhanced machine learning algorithms.

The package makes use of the open-source `Qiskit SDK <https://qiskit.org/>`_ for the execution of quantum processes.

It was orginally developed as part of my end-of-degree thesis for my Computer Engineering degree at UAM.

Installation
-------------
Currently, the package is available for Python versions 3.7-3.10, regardless of platform. Stable versions are available for install via `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/scikit-qlearn/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install scikit-qlearn

The latest version can also be manually installed by cloning the main branch of the repository:
