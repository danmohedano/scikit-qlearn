Version 1.2
==============

Changes:

* Addition of parametrized constant to `ExpandedAmplitudeEncoding` instead of always making the expansion with a value of :math:`1.0`.
* Remove the requirement of normalized inputs in `AmplitudeEncoding`, as some subroutines can work around that problem. The method will always normalize the input now.
* Added check in `AmplitudeEncoding` for empty or null vectors (all components equal to 0).
* Fixed dataset encodings for `AmplitudeEncoding` and `ExpandedAmplitudeEncoding`.
