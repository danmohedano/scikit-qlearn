Version 1.2
==============

Changes:

* `Encoding` Module:
    * Addition of parametrized constant to `ExpandedAmplitudeEncoding` instead of always making the expansion with a value of :math:`1.0`.
    * Remove the requirement of normalized inputs in `AmplitudeEncoding`, as some subroutines can work around that problem. The method will always normalize the input now.
    * Added check in `AmplitudeEncoding` for empty or null vectors (all components equal to 0).
    * Fixed dataset encodings for `AmplitudeEncoding` and `ExpandedAmplitudeEncoding`.
    * Reworked kernel calculations to improve performance.
* `Clustering` Module:
    * Reworked clustering algorithms to improve performance.
    * Updated class methods to conform to sklearn's estimator API.
* Tutorials:
    * Updated :ref:`encodingstutorial` and :ref:`kerneltutorial` tutorials to reflect changes in the module.
    * Updated :ref:`clusteringtutorial` tutorial to reflect changes in the module.
